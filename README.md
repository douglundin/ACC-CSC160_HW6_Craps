(Game: craps) Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos. Write a program
to play a variation of the game, as follows:
Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, â€¦, and 6, respectively.
Check the sum of the two dice.

(Case 1) If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you lose;

(Case 2) if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win;

(Case 3) if the sum is another value (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established.

    Continue to roll the dice until
        either a 7
        or the same point value is rolled.
    If 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise, you win.

Your program acts as a single player.
